# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Selecting from many options with Switch Statements
* Adding a default option in Switch statements
* Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
* Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
* Returning Boolean Values from Functions
* Return Early Pattern for Functions
* Counting Cards
* Build JavaScript Objects
* Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator
* Accessing Objects Properties with Bracket Notation
* Accessing Objects Properties with Variables
* Using Objects for Lookups
* Testing Objects for Properties
* Manipulating Complex Objects

**Thoughts:** Breezed through most exercises because they were reviews of what I already knew. Although switch statements were completely new for me.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Accessing Nested Objects
* Accessing Nested Arrays
* Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
* Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
* Count Backwards With a For Loop
* Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
* Nesting For Loops
* Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
* Profile Lookup
* Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
* Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript

**Thoughts:** More review except for nested if statements. There was a challenge that illustrated nested if statements and the fact that a function is exited as soon as return is reached.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Going to stop putting every lesson i did here. Just the beginning and end
* Started at - Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range 
* Ended at the "Factoralize a Number" challenge


**Thoughts:** Extremely frustrated trying to figure out the factoralizd challenge. Spent at least 45 mins on it with no luck. I'm thinking I should review earlier FCC lessons that I skipped (I thought my prior knowledge covered) to see if they went over challenges similar to this.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Started at - "Factoralize a Number" challenge
* Ended at - Check for Palindromes


**Thoughts:** I now understand the "For" loop solution of the factorialize challenge. But still need to dig deeper into the recursive function solution. I came up with a solution for the "Check for Palindromes" challenge after I finally found the correct regex for non-alphanumeric chararacters (\W).

### Day 4: January 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Title Case a Sentence"


**Thoughts:** Toughest challenge yet. Took more than 3 hrs to figure out something that works and my solution is still very convoluted.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Return Largest Numbers in Arrays"


**Thoughts:** I had the base of the solution done really quickly but had silly mistakes with checking the length of the argument and nested for loops which dragged it out an hour.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

### Day 7: January 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

### Day 8: January 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Mutations"

**Thoughts:** Took an hour at the computer and an additional hour on paper to work it out. My solution worked but was outrageously complex compared to the basic solution in the hint. Need to focus on creating the minimum amount of variables and loops.

### Day 18: January 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Build a Random Quote Machine
* Show the local weather

**Thoughts:** Finsihed up random quote machine app and figured out how to allow the user to click a button to tweet the quote. Struggled getting geolocation to work in CodePen. Seems like the auto-run behavior was the issue.

### Day 19: January 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Show the local weather

**Thoughts:** Figured out how to use geolocation in the browser and pass coordinates in a request to a weather API.

### Day 20: January 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Show the local weather

**Thoughts:** Got stuck on figuring out how to create a toggle to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit. I think it is a scope issue or has to do with my clickable button loading after the API request returns data since I have the button set to appear when the data returns.
