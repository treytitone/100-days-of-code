# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Selecting from many options with Switch Statements
* Adding a default option in Switch statements
* Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
* Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
* Returning Boolean Values from Functions
* Return Early Pattern for Functions
* Counting Cards
* Build JavaScript Objects
* Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator
* Accessing Objects Properties with Bracket Notation
* Accessing Objects Properties with Variables
* Using Objects for Lookups
* Testing Objects for Properties
* Manipulating Complex Objects

**Thoughts:** Breezed through most exercises because they were reviews of what I already knew. Although switch statements were completely new for me.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Accessing Nested Objects
* Accessing Nested Arrays
* Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
* Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
* Count Backwards With a For Loop
* Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
* Nesting For Loops
* Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
* Profile Lookup
* Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
* Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript

**Thoughts:** More review except for nested if statements. There was a challenge that illustrated nested if statements and the fact that a function is exited as soon as return is reached.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Going to stop putting every lesson i did here. Just the beginning and end
* Started at - Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range 
* Ended at the "Factoralize a Number" challenge


**Thoughts:** Extremely frustrated trying to figure out the factoralizd challenge. Spent at least 45 mins on it with no luck. I'm thinking I should review earlier FCC lessons that I skipped (I thought my prior knowledge covered) to see if they went over challenges similar to this.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* Started at - "Factoralize a Number" challenge
* Ended at - Check for Palindromes


**Thoughts:** I now understand the "For" loop solution of the factorialize challenge. But still need to dig deeper into the recursive function solution. I came up with a solution for the "Check for Palindromes" challenge after I finally found the correct regex for non-alphanumeric chararacters (\W).

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Title Case a Sentence"


**Thoughts:** Toughest challenge yet. Took more than 3 hrs to figure out something that works and my solution is still very convoluted.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Return Largest Numbers in Arrays"


**Thoughts:** I had the base of the solution done really quickly but had silly mistakes with checking the length of the argument and nested for loops which dragged it out an hour.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Confirm the Ending"
* "Repeat a string repeat a string"
* "Truncate a string"


**Thoughts:** Zipped through three challenges. Feeling good!

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp

* "Chunky Monkey"
* "Slasher Flick"
* "Mutations"


**Thoughts:** Zipped through the first two. Stuck on "Mutations" for now.
